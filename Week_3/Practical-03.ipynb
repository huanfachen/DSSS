    "Here are a list of potentially important hyperparameters for XGBoost, recommended by [this post](https://towardsdatascience.com/xgboost-fine-tune-and-optimize-your-model-23d996fab663):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `max_depth`: The maximum depth per tree. A deeper tree might increase the performance, but also the complexity and chances to overfit. The value must be an integer greater than 0. Default is 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `learning_rate`: The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while your model optimizes toward its objective. A low learning rate makes computation slower, and requires more rounds to achieve the same reduction in residual error as a model with a high learning rate. But it optimizes the chances to reach the best optimum. The value must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `n_estimators`: The number of trees in the ensemble. Equivalent to the number of boosting rounds. The value must be an integer greater than 0. Default is 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `colsample_bytree`: Represents the fraction of columns to be randomly sampled for each tree. It might improve overfitting.\n",
    "The value must be between 0 and 1. Default is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `subsample`: Represents the fraction of observations to be sampled for each tree. A lower values prevent overfitting but might lead to under-fitting.\n",
    "The value must be between 0 and 1. Default is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `alpha (reg_alpha)`: L1 regularization on the weights (Lasso Regression). When working with a large number of features, it might improve speed performances. It can be any integer. Default is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `lambda (reg_lambda)`: L2 regularization on the weights (Ridge Regression). It might help to reduce overfitting. It can be any integer. Default is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `gamma`: Gamma is a pseudo-regularisation parameter (Lagrangian multiplier), and depends on the other parameters. The higher Gamma is, the higher the regularization. It can be any integer. Default is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last three hyperparameters - alpha, lambda, and gamma - are related to the regularization of the model. In machine learning, regularization is a number of techniques to reduce the model complexity and the chances of overfitting.\n",
