In the case of a regression, the null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between our variables-- increasing $x$ has no effect on $y$. In other words, that the regression line is flat: $\\beta_1=0$ . A p-value of 0.05 means that the coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% level. In our case, the p-value is 0.000 (note: this doesn't mean it's equal to zero, just very very small), and we can therefore reject the null hypothesis that $\\beta_1=0$ at the 1% confidence level. However, this isn't the end of the story-- remember our weird negative intercept, and the fact that our model explains less than 20% of the variation in hourly wages ($R^2=0.181$). For a good overview of what exactly a p-value is, and why we should be cautious when interpreting them, see this [journal article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6532382/).\n"

We may also suspect that older people earn more, since they have more experience and are more senior. We've also seen i previous classes that there are significant disparities in income. Considering we have data on all these variables, we can set up the following model:\n",

Unlike a continuous variable, we're not interested in the change in $y$ that results from a 1 unit increase in $x$, since our units have no meaningful order. Instead, we'll have to pick one of the categories (called a **base category**/**reference category**), and compare each of the other categories in that variable against this one. You can specify the base category explicitly, or python will pick one for you. As such, for a categorical variable with $n$ categories, we get $n-1$ coefficeints which denote the change in $y$ associated with membership of a given category compared to the base category. For example, if we have a categorical variable with three levels $a, b, c$ where $a$ is the base category, we would get *two* coefficients: $\\beta_1 b$ and $\\beta_2 c$.

It also provides relatively useful information about the importance of unemployment across the country for each election. We can't really apply the same thinking to this situation, since we only have six time periods. If we ran a separate regression for each county, we would only have six observations per regression-- nowhere near enough to satisfy the central limit theorem (at least n>30). The insights would also be of limited utility; we would get over 3000 unique estimates for the realtionship between county-level employment and election results.

Hence, even if a variable like Socio-Economic Status is not explicitly measured, because of random assignment, we can be reasonably confident that the effects of SES are approximately equal for all groups. Of course, random assignment is usually not possible with most survey research. If we want to control for the effect of a variable, we must explicitly measure it. If we don’t measure it, we can’t control for it. In practice, there will almost certainly be some variables we have failed to measure (or have measured poorly), so our models will likely suffer from some degree of omitted variable bias. \n",
        ">When we have panel data (the same people/states/counties. etc. measured at two or more points in time) another alternative presents itself: we can use the subjects as their own controls. With panel data we can control for stable characteristics (i.e. characteristics that do not change across time) whether they are measured or not. These include such things as sex, race, and ethnicity for individuals, or urban/rural, topography, economic structure for geographic areas. The idea is that, whatever effect these variables have at one point in time, they will have the same effect at a different point in time because the values of such variables do not change. \n",

        "* $\\alpha_i$ and $\\epsilon_{it}$ are both error terms. $\\epsilon_{it}$ is different for each individual at each point in time. $\\alpha_i$ only varies across individuals but not across time. We can think of $\\alpha_i$ as representing the effects of all the time invariant/stable variables that have NOT been included in the model. So, given that we have 6 time periods for each county then the six records for county 1 would all have the same value for $\\alpha_1$, the six records for county 2 would all have the same value for $\\alpha_2$, etc. But, $\\epsilon_{it}$ is free to be different for every case at every time period.\n",

All that is left is the within-subject variability. So, with a fixed effects model, we are analyzing what causes individual’s values to change across time. Variables whose values do not change (like race or gender) cannot cause changes across time (unless their effects change across time as well). However, whatever effect they have at one time is the same effect that they have at other times, so the effects of such stable characteristics are controlled. \n",
