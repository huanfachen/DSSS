    "This library has been developed by [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/) and it provides a function named bias_variance_decomp() that help us to estimate the bias vs variance for various models over many bootstrap samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of bias_variance_decomp() is that: given the training and testing data and the predictive algorithm, in each round, it get a bootstrap sample of the training data, which is used to train a model, and then the model is applied to the testing data, which leads to predictions on the testing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the sampled training data is different in each round, the predictions on the testing data differ in each round. We can combine the multilple-round predictions (on the testing data) to estimate the bias and variance of the predictive algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The bias is the difference between the average prediction across multiple rounds and the actual values (of the testing data)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The variance is the variance of predictions over multiple rounds (of the testing data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note - the bias and variance of the algorithm is evaluated using the multiple-round prediction errors on the testing data, rather than the training data. The training data is only used to train the model, instead of evaluating the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read the documentation [here](https://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/evaluate/bias_variance_decomp/) and code [here](https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend/blob/master/mlxtend/evaluate/bias_variance_decomp.py).\n",
